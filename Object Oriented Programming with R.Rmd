- **S3** and **S4** are important things in OOP in R-Language. 

- *S3* is used to overload the function, so that the functin can be called with different names and it depends on the types of input parameter or the number of parameters.

**S3 Class**: In R, we define a function which will create a class and return the object of the created class. 
```{r}
s <- list(name = "Ram", age = 29, GPA = 4.0)  
class(s) <- "Faculty"
s
```
```{r}
GPA =function(obj){
  UseMethod("GPA")
}
```

```{r}
GPA.default <- function(obj){  
cat("We are calling generic function\n")  
}  
GPA(s)
```
```{r}
GPA.faculty <- function(obj){  
cat("Final GPA is ",obj$GPA,"\n")  
}  
GPA(s)
```
